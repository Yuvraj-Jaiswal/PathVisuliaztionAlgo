# PathVisuliaztionAlgo
This project involves developing a dynamic and interactive web application using React to visualize various graph traversal algorithms, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Astar. The visualization helps users understand the step-by-step process these algorithms use to navigate and find paths in a graph.
